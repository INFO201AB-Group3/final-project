# final-project

* Final project for INFO 201AB

## Project Description
We have chosen to work with the "Percentage of tertiary qualifications awarded to women by field of education"  database from the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The OECD is a Paris-based organisation with roots in post - WWII Europe. They provide a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems.  They collect data from around the world and provide access to their statistical databases through [stats.oced.org](http://stats.oecd.org/) website. 

The database we are using provides information about postsecondary degrees awarded to both men and women in 8 different fields and many countries from around the world.  [Our dataset](http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=70547)

Our target audience will be current or future university students and educators. These statistics can be used by the universities to influence students at a young age and help create a more diverse number of men and women being awarded postsecondary degrees. 

Ideally, we can use the data to compare and contrast the number of degrees awarded to men and women, and how this has changed in the past decade. We can also compare countries in different parts of the world.  

Specifically, we can ask:

* How has the number of degrees awarded changed between 2005 (the first year they have data) and 2014 (the last year)?
* Are there any differences between degrees awarded to men and women? If so, how? How are specific fields different?
* Are there noticeable differences between two-three countries in different parts of the world? For example, we can compare countries in the North America, Asia, and Europe areas of the world.  
		

## Technical Description
We used a combination of HTML compiled with KnitR and the Shiny app to format the final presentation. We downloaded and saved the data locally in CSV files. Most of our data wrangling will be done with `dplyr`. We researched visualization packages and utilized `ggplot2` or `plotly` for more interactive charts/maps. We used statistical analysis and machine learning to help us find averages, differences, standard deviations, etc. to answer our questions concisely.
