## **About the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**
  The OECD is a Paris-based organisation with roots in post - WWII Europe. They provide a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems.  They collect data from around the world and provide access to their statistical databases at [stats.oced.org](http://stats.oecd.org/).

## **Our Project**
We chose to work with the ["Percentage of Tertiary Qualifications Awarded to Women by Field of Education"](http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=70547#) database, which provides information about postsecondary degrees awarded to both men and women in 8 different fields and in many countries from around the world. We believe that these statistics can be used by corporations, universities, educators to influence students at a young age and help create a more diverse number of men and women being awarded postsecondary degrees. 
Ideally, we can use the data to compare and contrast the number of degrees awarded to men and women, and how this has changed in the past decade.  We can also compare how countries in different parts of the world are distributing these degrees. 
Specifically, we can ask:
* How has the percentage of degrees awarded to a specific gender changed between 2005 (the first year data was collected) and 2014 (the most recent year)?
* Are there any differences between degrees awarded to men and women? If so, how? How are specific fields different?
* Are there noticeable differences between two-three countries in different parts of the world? For example, we can compare countries in the North America, Asia, and Europe areas of the world.

## **Our Analysis**
There were many interesting trends we discovered in this dataset. For example, in 2014, countries like Turkey, Portugal, Italy, and Colombia awarded more women bachelors degrees in science, mathematics, and computing than men. Furthermore, if we look at how these percentages changed over time, we can see that in Turkey and Portugal, men were the majority in these fields prior to 2010. These kinds of observations can be used by other countries who seek to increase diversity in certain fields.
As another example, we found for most countries that the distribution of bachelors degrees in engineering, manufacturing, and construction were relatively unchanged in the past decade with an average of only 24.2% graduates being women. An interesting exception was with Saudi Arabia, which had an astonishing increase from 8.4% to 64.2% between 2013 and 2014. Again, these findings can be very useful for countries to work together to positively impact the economy overall. However, we also found that the data led us to ask more inquiries such as how much degrees awarded in a certain field determine which industry a graduate ends up working in. Beyond the scope of our application, we can use this dataset in conjunction with others to find interesting correlations.

## **Trends** 
#### **Comparison Around the World**
* This tab renders a world map that lets the user look at statistics from around the world by filtering gender, level of education, field of study, and year.

#### **Comparison of Women in Engineering**
